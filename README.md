# Admin-Dashboard
This is a static admin dashboard I created to test my html/css skills while learning grid. 
As of now, this project is *mostly* complete. I plan to revisit it in the future
to possibly further style CSS as well as add API elements to the trending box
and fix minor styling defects. This project was an important one for me in terms of learning
not only how to better use CSS but how to actually begin to plan (and follow through) with the
layout of a site/dashboard.
